# Time Series Pro - Project Context

## Current State Analysis
Date: 2025-08-21
Repository: timeseriespro

## Application Architecture

### Core Functionality
The application provides time series forecasting capabilities through:

1. **Data Management**
   - CSV file upload and validation
   - SQLite database for persistence
   - Project-based organization of forecasts

2. **Forecasting Models**
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
   - Prophet (Facebook's forecasting library)
   - Linear Regression
   - Model comparison and evaluation

3. **Web Interface**
   - Flask-based web application
   - Interactive charts and visualizations
   - Project dashboard for managing forecasts
   - Results comparison between models

### Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.x, Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Charts**: Chart.js
- **Forecasting**: scikit-learn, Prophet, statsmodels

## Current Development Status

### Modified Files (from git status)
- `forecasting.py` - Core algorithm implementations
- `main.py` - Flask application setup
- `routes.py` - Web routes and API endpoints  
- `templates/project.html` - UI updates
- `pyproject.toml` - Dependencies and project config
- `instance/forecasting.db` - Database changes

### New Files
- Documentation files (README.md, LICENSE, etc.)
- Screenshots and assets

## Key Areas for Development

### Potential Improvements
1. **Model Enhancement**
   - Additional forecasting algorithms
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Ensemble methods

2. **User Experience**
   - Better data validation feedback
   - Advanced visualization options
   - Export capabilities

3. **Performance**
   - Caching for repeated forecasts
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Batch operations

4. **Data Management**
   - Multiple data sources
   - Data preprocessing options
   - Historical data management

## Development Priorities
1. Maintain existing functionality while adding features
2. Ensure robust error handling and validation
3. Keep the interface intuitive and responsive
4. Document all changes and architectural decisions

This context will be updated as the project evolves through the PM system workflow.
